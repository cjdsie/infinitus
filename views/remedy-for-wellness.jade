          p Remedy for Wellness wanted revolutionary change. The company is located in St. Johnâ€™s, Newfoundland and specializes in homeopathic medicine. We helped them completely rebrand (including a name change) and overhaul their web presence. 
          p The largest part of the project was setting up the eCommerce store. Now, they are able to sell over 6000 products online and have a strategic monthly online marketing campaign in place.
