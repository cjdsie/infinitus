        h2 Marble Mountain Ski Resort Brand Strategy &amp; Website Development

        .case-studycopy
          p Marble Mountain Resort wanted to break free from being seen as a small, local ski destination. With some of the best skiing opportunities east of the Rockies, we knew that Marble Mountain required our big vision to get the big results they were looking for. 
          p In December 2012, we launched the new Marble Mountain Resort website and mobile website. The site includes advanced social media integration (including user-generated content), online booking, and a beautiful design and brand experience.
          p The project was very complex and included two versions of their website (off-season and winter), over 70 pages of content, and custom website capabilities. We relied on the extraordinary team we built to execute the project strategically, on time, and on budget.
          p Our new design decreased their bounce rate by a full 7%. We also created a very intuitive design, which allowed visitors to quickly find exactly what they wanted, instead of having to sift through the website. We also developed the platform to accept online purchases for passes and events. The new eCommerce capabilities, coupled with strategic calls-to-actions to increase conversions, resulted in real financial results and a more efficient operation.
