          p Located in Newfoundland and Labrador, the town of Grand Falls-Windsor has been a long-standing client of our web agency for the past seven years. In that amount of time, we’ve completed various versions of the Town’s website. 
          p The newest version features advanced programming, superior website design and development, online brand translation and an advanced content management system (CMS).
          p By using our analytic software, we determined that people came to the website for three main things: events, news, and business listings. Bearing this in mind, we brought the information to the forefront of the website and integrated the branding developed by Tract Consulting.
          p In doing so, the Town of Grand-Falls Windsor now has a well-branded online presence that can be used for many years to come.
          p Since we started working with the Town of Grand Falls-Windsor, we’ve doubled their visitors, decreased the bounce rate from 49% to 23%, increased the number of pages each person visits, while decreasing the time needed to spend on the site. This shows us that people can now find what they are looking for.
