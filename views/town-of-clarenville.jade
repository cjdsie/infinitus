          p The Town of Clarenville relied on us to develop their new town site and it's been an amazing success!
          p The new town website has attracted over 30,000 visitors in less then 6 months. The site engages and informs the visitor (evident by the above-average time on the site of 3 minutes per visit). Now, all town information is easily accessible to citizens and tourists. As an on-going effort, we also maintain all of the town's departments including recreation and the fire department.
